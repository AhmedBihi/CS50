1.  Return resource usage measures and statistics for a calling process 
    or all the children of the calling process
    
2.  16

3.  Because its a struct and calculate needs access to members in the struct.

4.  Opens text in reading mode, reads char for char using fgetc until EOF.
    For every c value (from fgetc) the for loop checks for 
    different stuff (like, isdigit() and isalpha()), and saves c in word array.  
     
5.  Its easier to error check when reading one char at a time, fscanf could give us
    a harder time to keep track of the number of characters we read.

6.  Because the input will be strings that won't change, because they are in a dictionary.

7.  I used a hash table with linked list in every index of the hashtable.
    Every node of the linked list contain word and a node pointer.
    
8.  TIME IN TOTAL: 0.216.

9.  I tried several hashing functions but most of them gave me segmentation faults, 
    so I just stuck with a hashing function called lose lose from 
    Kernighan & Ritchie (1st ed).

10. Yes I need a better hashing function.
