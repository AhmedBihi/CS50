0.  PNG:  16777216(24 bit) GIF = 16777216 (24 bit)
    JPEG: 16777216 (24 bit) BMP: 4,294,967,296 (32 bit)
1.  GIF
2.  Lossy compression alters the image to reduce its file size 
    whileist lossless compression does not.
3.  JPEG
4.  When a FAT file is erased the system modifies the filenames
    first character to signal that the file has been deleted
    and that the memory space could be recycled. The system
    also moves all of the files FAT clusters to the hard drives
    list of free clusters.
5.  Overwrite all my deleted data with one or two passes of random data.
6.  A library that provides fast and proper width integer for an implementation.
7.  Because the standard integer types sizes are implementation defined and
    may vary across different systems. The integers in stdint.h can also be
    specified to a number of N of bits with uintN_t.
8.  BYTE = 1 byte, DWORD = 4 bytes, LONG = 4 bytes, WORD = 2 bytes.
9.  The two first bytes is a WORD thats specifies bfType (file type).
    BM (0x4d42) is for bitmap.
10. bfSize = size of bitmap file in bytes, 
    biSize = size of structure in bytes
11. It denotes if its a top-down or bottom-up device-independent
    bitmaps (DIBs). If biHeight is negative its a top-down DIB.
12. biBitCount specifies the number of bits per pixel, that correlates
    to the maximum number of color in a bitmap.
13. fopen could not create a file with that name or something similar.
14. Because we read one rgbtriple per loop "spin", and in every loop
    spin we write the rgbtriple to outptr.
15. padding = (4 - (3 * 3) % 4) % 4
    padding = (4 - 1) % 4
    padding = 3
16. Skipps over padding.
17. The fseek function is used to change the file position of the stream stream. 
    The value of whence must be one of the constants SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, 
    or SEEK_END,to indicate whether the offset is relative to the beginning of the file, 
    the current file position, or the end of the file, respectively.
18. Gotcha! It's Rob Bowden from the shorts holding a cat!
